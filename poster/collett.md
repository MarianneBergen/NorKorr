# Case 1: Letters from Norwegian Writer and Feminist Camilla Collett (1813–95)
The National Library in Norway has approximately 1000 letters written by the Norwegian author Camilla Collett (1813-95) in its manuscript collection. More than half of these letters have never been published. Collett’s handwriting is difficult to read, so there has been little research on them, and the library wants to make the letters more available by transcribing, encoding and publishing them. One of the publications is a digital edition containing approximately 50 letters written by Collett in the years 1841-51.The edition is part of the library’s source edition series NB kilder, published on the e-book website Bokselskap: [http://www.bokselskap.no/boker/collettbrev1841_51/tittelside](http://www.bokselskap.no/boker/collettbrev1841_51/tittelside)

The letters are encoded in TEI P5 XML. To get the letters registered and integrated into the CorrespSearch web service we create a CMIF file based on the metadata already recorded in the correspDesc element in our XML files.
