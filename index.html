<h1> Norwegian Correspondences Project Website</h1>

This is the project website for Norwegian Correspondences, a collaboration between a number of Norwegian Cultural Heritage Institutions that host editions of letters and correspondences.

We use this page for documentation and iterative publishing of results and as a means to disseminate our findings to the public. All work here is a work-in-progress.
